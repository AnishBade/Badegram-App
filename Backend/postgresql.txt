For Linux users, you can log in as follows:
sudo su postgres

Then, enter psql.

Great – let’s create the database:
CREATE DATABASE coredb;

To connect to the database, we need USER with a password:
CREATE USER core WITH PASSWORD 'anishcore123';

the next step is to grant access to our database to the new user:
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE coredb TO core;

We also need to make sure this user can create a database. This will be helpful when
we can run tests. To run tests, Django will configure a full environment but will also use a database:
ALTER USER core CREATEDB;

\list or \l: list all databases
\c <db name>: connect to a certain database
\dt: list all tables in the current database using your search_path
\dt *.: list all tables in the current database regardless your search_path
\d  to show all tables in the database
